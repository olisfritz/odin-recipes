    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>200-380g thinly sliced beef</li>
        <li>1/2 small-medium sized onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup dashi</li>
        <li>1 tbsp sake</li>
        <li>2 tbsp mirin</li>
        <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 sliced green onion</li>
        <li>Japanese rice</li>
        <li>Benishoga (picked ginger) - Optional</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium sized pan, mix together dashi, sake, mirin, sugar, and soy sauce
            and heat up the pan to medium heat.</li>
        <li>Once the sugar dissolves and the sauce starts bubbling, add the onions.</li>
        <li>Once onions are translucent, turn down the leat slightly and add the beef.</li>
        <li>Let the beef cook and immediately stop when the meat turns pale pink. The
            residual heat should cook the meat fully. This prevents over-cooking of the meat.
        </li>
        <li>To assemble, get a medium sized bowl and add a bed of rice. Add in the beef (just
            enough to cover the rice) and top it off with a sprinkle of green onion and benishoga (optional).
        </li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!! You can also add in a poached egg if you like!!</li>
    </ol>
